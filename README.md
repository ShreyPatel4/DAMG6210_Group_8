# Development of a HIPAA-Compliant Data Front and Database for Healthcare Middleware

**Project Start Date**: September 26, 2023

## Phase 1: Topic and Objectives [3% of grade]

**Date**: September 26, 2023

**Objective**: 
Decide on a database topic and establish the mission statement and mission objectives that the database will accomplish.

**Deliverables**:
1. Statement of the chosen topic.
2. Mission statement and mission objectives document.

**Outcome**: 
A clear understanding of the project topic and the objectives to be achieved.

## Phase 2: Database Design, Initial ERD [5% of grade]

**Timeline**: [End Date]

**Objective**: 
Create an initial Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) depicting the database for the middleware system, allowing for data collection, processing, and reporting for healthcare and insurance providers.

**Deliverables**:
1. An initial ERD with a minimum of 10 entities.
2. A database design document describing the business problems being addressed, list of all entities, their relationships, and key design decisions.

**Outcome**: 
An initial ERD and design document serving as the foundation for the subsequent development phases.

## Phase 3: Final ERD [5% of grade]

**Timeline**: [End Date]

**Objective**: 
Refine the initial ERD based on the instructor’s feedback, focusing on further ‘normalization’ of the database entities, reducing redundant data, and recognizing additional entities.

**Deliverables**:
1. A refined and final ERD.
2. A brief description identifying the changes made to the initial ERD.

**Outcome**: 
A finalized ERD and an updated design document reflecting all modern design changes, ready for database implementation.

## Phase 4: Database Implementation [7% of grade]

**Timeline**: [End Date]

**Objective**: 
Implement the database design and enter a minimal amount of data using SQL scripts, Data Import Wizard, and/or stored procedures.

**Deliverables**:
1. SQL code implementing the database design.
2. At least ten rows of data for each table.
3. Implementation of specified database objects like stored procedures, views, triggers, constraints, indexes, etc.
4. Data visualizations using Power BI/Tableau.

**Outcome**: 
A fully implemented and populated database, with data visualizations and optional GUI for CRUD operations.

## Phase 5: Presentation [5% of grade]

**Timeline**: [End Date]

**Objective**: 
Present the database design project to the class, showcasing all the developed components and functionalities.

**Deliverables**:
1. A PowerPoint slide deck highlighting the project.
2. Design documents and the final ERD.
3. Sample DDL statements for implementing the database.
4. Data visualizations created using Power BI/Tableau.
5. A live demo of the project displaying the database and the visualization layer.
